GateEngine is the heart of my little project
it allows, though currently not fully implemented, to dynamicly manage and match proxies and servers.
Or well it has the potential to do so.

This is inteded to make a dynamic Hypixel like routing possible approach where you have Proxies that you connect to via *Proxyname*.example.com. 
And depending on the proxy you chose you may have different servers like alpha.hypixel.net but in other cases you connect to a different Proxy but have access to the same servers.

Note: I used the dynamic server api as a base instead of the http api as it allows me to be able to dynamicly register and unregister servers while using these severs as default servers.

This is for a [Gate Proxy](https://github.com/dilllxd/dynamicserverapi) with my [Golden Gate Plugin](https://github.com/zERO123331/GoldenGateProxy) which is based on the [dynamic server api]() and my [testtemplate](https://github.com/zERO123331/testtemplate) repo 
It also requires the [GateWay Plugin](https://github.com/zERO123331/GateWay) to be intalled on the server which is currently only as a Plugin available
